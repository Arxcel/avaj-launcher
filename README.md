# avaj-launcher
The first java project of the 42 school program.
I will write better description, but for now: 
You just need jdk(7 or higher) to run the project. Clone the repo and run ./make.sh.
The script will compile the source code, run the programm with the input parameter "scenario.txt"
and save the results in out/simulation.txt (also showing the contents of simulation.txt to console).
